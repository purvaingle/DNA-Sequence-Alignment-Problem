# DNA-Sequence-Alignment-Problem
Please find the detailed description of the problem statement [here.](https://github.com/purvaingle/DNA-Sequence-Alignment-Problem/blob/main/CSCI570_Fall22_Project.pdf)

Approach to the problem:

• Implemented basic and memory efficient Dynamic Programming algorithms for the DNA Sequence Alignment of two strings.

• Computed the cost of the alignment, first string alignment, second string alignment (Consisting of A, C, T, G, _ (gap) characters), time and memory usage of the two solutions.

• Visualized and analyzed the CPU time and memory usage of both the solutions by generating plots of the CPU time vs problem size and of Memory usage vs problem size for the two solutions.

Nature of the Graph:

Basic: Linear

Efficient: Polynomial (Quadratic)

Explanation: The memory efficient algorithm only consumes a linear amount of memory because it does not need to store the whole dynamic programming table of optimal alignments – it only needs to store two columns: the current column and the previous column.

Nature of the Graph:

Basic: Polynomial 

Efficient: Polynomial

Explanation: The memory efficient algorithm takes twice as long as the basic algorithm, since it performs Cmn work at the root level, and Cmn/2 at the next level, and so on, which sums up to 2Cmn = O(mn). The basic algorithm simply uses dynamic programming, and there are mn unique subproblems, hence the runtime O(mn).
